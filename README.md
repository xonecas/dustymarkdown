Dusty Markdown
==============

This project is the new content manager under xonecas.com.
It's very minimal and light, developer friendly. The idea 
is that you can write the dynamic content in markdown and
use dust to combine static and dynamic.

This app is only possible thanks to:
------------------------------------

* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Ender *no-library*
* Dust.js
* Markdown
